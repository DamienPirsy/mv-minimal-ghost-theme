MV minimal â€” Minimal & light theme for my personal blog
=======================================================

## Features

- **Credits**. I used the [*Undefined*](https://github.com/curiositry/undefined-ghost-theme) theme by Curiositry as a starting point for a v.3 template.

- **Responsive** Thanks to the Bulma CSS framework.

- **Modular** Used partials and templating a lot.

- **Still under development** No membership section since I don't need it, while search functionality (and some other things here and there) is still missing 

## Disqus

To enable Disqus integration just change `[DISQUS_ID]` with your ID in `partials/comments.hbs`

## Demo

Head over to [***my (italian) blog**](https://www.matteovignoli.it) for a working demo.
